# RedditMasoom

Hello! I'm Masoom, a passionate developer-in-training from India. This is a portfolio project for my Codecademy Full Stack Engineer Professional Certification. It's a custom Reddit client that I built to practice my front-end skills and learn how to work with APIs.

## My Project Journey

It was a fantastic learning experience! I learned how to:

*   Customize a React application from the ground up.
*   Integrate with a third-party API (the Reddit JSON API).
*   Solve tricky CORS issues using a proxy, both for local development and for production deployment on Vercel.
*   Manage application state efficiently with Redux Toolkit.
*   Structure a project in a clean and scalable way.

## What I Built (Features)

*   **Custom Subreddit Feed**: Displays posts from a handpicked list of my favorite developer-focused subreddits.
*   **View Posts & Comments**: You can click on a post to see what the community is saying.
*   **Simple & Clean UI**: I focused on creating a minimal and easy-to-use interface.

## My Tech Stack

*   **React**: For building the user interface.
*   **Redux Toolkit**: For managing the application's state.
*   **Vercel**: For deploying the application.

## How to Run This Project

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

This will run the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### `npm run build`

This will build the app for production into the `build` folder.

## What's Next?

I have many ideas for the future! I would love to add user authentication, the ability to upvote and comment, and a more detailed post view.

Thank you for checking out my project!
